## Stuff Practised
- States
- Style attribute/object for conditional rendering
- Event listeners
- Using a closure function to utilize parent functions within child components.
- useEffect since we want to check for a win everytime the dice state changes.
- .every() checks every item in an array for a condition and if they all satisfy it will return true
